# Euler Diagram Types

This package calculates the almost exact area of regions within Euler diagrams that are drawn with circles.

# Usage

The best documentation on the usage of this library is to be found in the test classes.  You should look at these to figure out how to create a new diagram.

# Limitations

  * Only deals with diagrams drawn with circles.
  * Does not handle circles that split a minimal region correctly.
  * Only considers diagrams with two levels of inclusion.

The above limitations are captured in two intentionally failing tests.  You should look at these for more detail.
